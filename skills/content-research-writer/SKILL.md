## Instructions

When a user requests writing assistance for enterprise documentation:

1. **Formalize Casual Input**

   Convert casual language to professional documentation style:

   **User input**: "Login doesn't work sometimes, users get stuck"

   **Formalized output**:
   > "Authentication failures occur intermittently, preventing users from accessing the system. Affected users are unable to proceed beyond the login screen."

   **Principles**:
   - Remove casual language ("doesn't work" → "failures occur")
   - Be specific ("sometimes" → "intermittently")
   - Use professional terminology
   - Maintain clarity (no jargon overload)
   - Preserve the user's meaning

2. **Provide Section-by-Section Feedback**

   As user writes each section, review for:

   ```markdown
   # Feedback: [Section Name]
